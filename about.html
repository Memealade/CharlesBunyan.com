            My name is Charles Bunyan, I'm a 14 year old freelance developer, I've been programming with python for around 2 - 3 years, and I hope to one day get a job at a large tech company, I believe anyone can program, I even made this at about 10PM, deploying the first build at 11pm, on my ipad, if that doesnt show how versatile programming can be, I don't know what can.

        <h1 style = "font-family:Verdana;text-align:Center;"> My Roadmap for this website:</h1>
        <p style = "font-family:Verdana;Text-align:Center;"> I hope in the future to be able to run this off of a 5G chip and a raspberry pi 4 cluster, this is not possible yet as Raspberry Pi 4s are extremely hard to find, especially compute modules, which are importantly for this, and a turing board (Used to pool all the Raspberry Pis) is
            like, 200 GBP? And also you need to use something called kubernetes, and then theres the issue with dynamic Ips, and port forwarding, it'd be easier to create my own router with a raspberry pi, and just use a regular 4gb model to host my website. </p>
